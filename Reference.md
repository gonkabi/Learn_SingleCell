### SequencEnG: an Interactive Knowledge base of Sequencing techniques

SequencEnG (acronym for Sequencing Techniques Engine for Genomics) to provide a tree-structured knowledge base of 66 different sequencing techniques and step-by-step NGS data analysis pipelines comparing popular tools.  
SequencEnG is designed to facilitate barrier-free learning of current NGS techniques and provides a user-friendly interface for searching through experimental and analysis methods.
